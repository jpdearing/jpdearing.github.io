   <p> 
        I was born and raised in a small town in Texas. After high school, I joined the army as a Multiple Launch Rocket System Fire Direction Specialist (13P). In 2011 I enrolled in Texas A&amp;M - Corpus Christi's Mechanical Engineering program. This is where my wife and I first met. Of course she was not interested at first, but I can be quite persistent. I finally wore her down enough to marry me in 2017 (she always wanted me, but she'll never admit it!).

        As of the creation of this page, my wife is 19 weeks pregnant with our first child, Connor. I am truly excited for this chapter in our lives, and I hope to one day pass my newfound coding knowledge to my children.
